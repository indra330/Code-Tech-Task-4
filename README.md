Detailed Project Features for a Productivity Tracker Chrome Extension
This productivity tracker Chrome extension, powered by the MERN stack for backend support, will help users manage their time more effectively by tracking website activity, blocking distractions, and syncing data across devices. Below are the detailed features categorized for better understanding:

1. Time Tracking
1.1. Active Time Monitoring
Purpose: Monitor and log the amount of time a user spends on each website.
How it works:
Tracks time on the active browser tab using Chrome's tab and activity APIs.
Automatically switches tracking when the user changes tabs or windows.
1.2. Website Categorization
Purpose: Classify websites into categories (e.g., Social Media, Work, Entertainment) to provide a breakdown of time spent.
How it works:
Use predefined categories for popular websites (e.g., Facebook → Social Media).
Allow users to customize categories via the extension popup.
1.3. Idle Time Detection
Purpose: Prevent overestimation by pausing tracking during idle periods.
How it works:
Uses Chrome's idle API to detect user inactivity (e.g., no mouse or keyboard input).
2. Blocking Distracting Websites
2.1. Custom Block List
Purpose: Allow users to specify a list of distracting websites to block during work hours.
How it works:
Users add websites to a blocklist via the extension popup.
When the user attempts to visit a blocked site, they are redirected to a motivational page or a blank screen.
2.2. Scheduled Blocking
Purpose: Block specific websites during certain times of the day (e.g., 9 AM - 5 PM).
How it works:
Users can set up a daily schedule in the extension settings.
Blocking rules are enforced based on the current time.
2.3. Focus Mode
Purpose: Temporarily block all distracting sites for a specific duration.
How it works:
A user enables Focus Mode from the popup, which activates a timer for blocking all non-whitelisted websites.
3. Productivity Reporting
3.1. Daily Reports
Purpose: Summarize the user’s website activity at the end of each day.
How it works:
Displays total time spent on each category and specific websites.
Highlights productive vs. unproductive time.
3.2. Weekly and Monthly Trends
Purpose: Help users identify long-term productivity trends.
How it works:
Aggregates daily reports into weekly and monthly graphs using backend data.
Displays trends such as most visited sites, least productive hours, etc.
3.3. Productivity Score
Purpose: Assign a score to the user’s daily activity based on time spent on productive websites vs. distractions.
How it works:
Weighted scoring system assigns points to different categories.
Generates a percentage-based productivity score.
4. Data Synchronization and User Preferences
4.1. Sync Across Devices
Purpose: Ensure users can access their productivity data and preferences on any device.
How it works:
Stores data in a MongoDB database via the backend.
Users authenticate with a unique account (via email, Google, etc.).
Syncs data on login, ensuring consistency across devices.
4.2. Cloud Storage
Purpose: Securely save time tracking data, blocklists, and reports in the cloud.
How it works:
Data is stored in MongoDB Atlas for reliability and scalability.
Backend APIs handle CRUD operations for user-specific data.
4.3. User Preferences
Purpose: Allow users to personalize their experience.
How it works:
Options to set themes (dark mode, light mode).
Configurable tracking intervals and notification settings.
5. Notifications and Alerts
5.1. Productivity Reminders
Purpose: Encourage users to stay focused.
How it works:
Sends alerts when the user spends too much time on distracting sites.
Customizable notification intervals (e.g., every 30 minutes).
5.2. Break Reminders
Purpose: Encourage healthy work habits.
How it works:
Sends reminders to take breaks after a certain amount of focused work time.
Users can configure work/break intervals (Pomodoro technique).
6. Integration with Backend
6.1. Data Handling
Purpose: Centralize user data for analysis and syncing.
How it works:
Backend (Node.js + Express) handles API requests from the extension.
MongoDB stores user data such as:
Time spent on websites.
Blocklists.
Productivity reports.
6.2. API Endpoints
Purpose: Enable communication between the extension and backend.
How it works:
GET /user/{id}: Retrieve user data.
POST /user/{id}: Save updated time tracking or blocklist data.
GET /reports/{id}: Fetch productivity reports.
7. User Authentication
7.1. Account Creation
Purpose: Allow users to create accounts for personalized tracking.
How it works:
Users sign up with email/password or third-party OAuth (Google, Facebook).
7.2. Secure Authentication
Purpose: Protect user data.
How it works:
Implements JWT-based authentication.
Ensures all API requests are authorized.
8. Optional Advanced Features
8.1. AI-Powered Insights
Use AI to analyze productivity trends and provide actionable recommendations.
8.2. Browser Performance Monitoring
Track browser performance metrics (e.g., memory usage) alongside productivity tracking.
8.3. Multi-Browser Support
Extend support to other browsers like Firefox or Edge using WebExtension APIs.
